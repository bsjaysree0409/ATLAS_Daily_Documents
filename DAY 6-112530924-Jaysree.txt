Task 1:

RegEX Symbols in linux 

List them down with description

. — Matches any single character except newline.

^ — Matches the start of a string.

$ — Matches the end of a string.

\ — Escape character (to treat metacharacters literally).

| — Logical OR (alternation).

() — Grouping.

[] — Character class (set of characters).

^ — Start of string.

$ — End of string.


Task 2:

If you are aware of Linux OS.. can you tell me the feature of Linux.

Linux is an open source software, ie. the source code is available freely to anyone to develop modify and change the codes
It is free of cost to download and use
Multile users can run the system simultaneously without interfearing each user.

Task 3:

What is Kernel ? can you explain about it in your words..


Kernel is the core component of the operating system. It acts as a bridge between computer (hardware) to the application (software).
Kernel helps in Process management, Memory management, File system storage and retreival, managing device drivers like keyboard, disc, usb etc.,
it provides a interface that allows program to request the read write operations

Task 4:

BASH in Linux full form and Explanation

BASH stands for Bourne Again SHell
It is a command line shell and scripting operator language used in Linux and Unix operating system. 
Run commands like copying files, moving files, listing directories, etc.

Task 5:

Now that you know Linux is also an Operating System like Windows..

What do you think is the difference between LInux and Windows

Linux is open, free, highly customizable, and great for servers, programmers, and those who want control.

Windows is user-friendly, widely supported commercially, and best for desktop users and mainstream software compatibility.

Task 6:

What are the basic components of Linux? Describe each in detail with diagrams.
1. Kernel
The core part of Linux that manages hardware resources.
2. System Libraries
Libraries provide functions that programs can use to interact with the kernel.
3. System Utilities
These are programs and tools that perform individual, specialized functions.
4. Shell
The shell is the command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system.
5.User Space
The environment where user applications run.

Task 7:

Is it legal to edit Kernal ? when do you think we have to in case?
Yes, it is legal to edit the Linux kernel.Anyone can legally edit the kernel code, customize it, and even distribute their modified versions, 
as long as they comply with the GPL license terms (e.g., sharing source code of modifications)

Task  8:

What is LILO? Explain
LILO stands for LInux LOader.
LILO is a boot loader for Linux operating systems.
A boot loader is a small program that runs when the computer starts and is responsible for loading the operating system into memory.


Task 9:


What is shell? How many shells are there and what are they ? can you explain.
A Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface to interact with the operating system.
It acts as a bridge between the user and the system
It accepts commands from the user and executes them by communicating with the kernel.

sh - Original Unix shell; basic and simple scripting
bash - Most common Linux shell; backward compatible with sh; supports advanced scripting features
csh - Syntax similar to C programming language; less popular now
tcsh  - Enhanced version of csh with command-line editing and completion
ksh  - Combines features of sh and csh; scripting enhancements
zsh  - Highly customizable; powerful features; often used by power users
fish  - User-friendly with smart suggestions and syntax highlighting


Task 10:

What is swap space?

When your computer runs out of RAM while running programs, the Linux kernel moves some inactive or less-used data from RAM to the swap space.
Swap space is a portion of the hard disk or storage device that is used by the operating system as virtual memory when the physical RAM (Random Access Memory) is full or insufficient.


Task 11:

What is Mount ? how do you mount and unmount file system in Linux?

Mounting is the process of attaching a storage device or filesystem to the existing directory structure so that 
it becomes accessible to the user.When you mount a device (like a hard disk partition, USB drive), you connect its filesystem to a 
specific directory (called the mount point) within the existing directory tree

Task 12:

What is chmod command ? how to use it?
chmod stands for change mode
It is a Linux command used to change the permissions of files and directories.
Permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.

Task 13:

Can you add a new user account? Crate a new user in different ways and paste ss

dministrator@f2b757d97a775bc:~$ sudo adduser newusername
[sudo] password for dministrator:
info: Adding user `newusername' ...
info: Selecting UID/GID from range 1000 to 59999 ...

Changing the user information for newusername
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: Jaysree
        Room Number []: 1
        Work Phone []: 1
        Home Phone []: 1
        Other []: 1
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y

dministrator@f2b757d97a775bc:~$


Go to Settings > Users
Click “Add User”
Enter name, username, password, and role (Standard/Admin)
Click Create

Task 14:

Can you change the password of a user?
How do you do that? Plz share ss

1. Change Your Own Password - passwd
dministrator@f2b757d97a775bc:~$ passwd
Changing password for dministrator.
Current password:
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully.

Task 15:

What is diff between Process and Thread?
A process is a program in execution.
When you run a program (like a text editor, browser, or a script), the operating system creates a process to manage and execute it.
Each process has its own memory, resources, and execution context (like the program counter, registers, etc.).

A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
A process can have multiple threads running at the same time.
All threads within the same process share memory and resources, but each thread has its own execution path (like its own program counter and stack).

Task 16:
